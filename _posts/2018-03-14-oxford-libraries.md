## Alexander Library of Ornithology
## All Souls College Library
7/10

The main feature of this library is the feeling of superiority & exclusivity that wafts over you when you enter the hallowed grounds of All Souls. You see, All Souls is a super-duper elite; it has no undergraduates, entry is by the so-called "[hardest exam in the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Souls_College,_Oxford)". You need to make a special application to be allowed to use the library (but it's actually very easy).

There are very few desks compared to the size of the library. The desks and seats are below average. Opening hours (Monday - Friday: 9:30am - 6:30pm) are the worst I've seen in Oxford.

Housed in a gorgeous church building. Has a big-ass chandelier. A bit noisy.

9/10

A classic of the Oxford repertoire, the Old Bod needs no introduction and is located in one of the most magnificent buildings in the city. I prefer the upper reading room, which has better views and is sometimes less full. Special features: the divinity school, and Duke Humfrey's library, both of which were locations for the Harry Potter films. The Duke Humfrey is too dark, go there to enjoy the 17th-century vibe but not for extended periods of work.

## Sackler Library
5/10 

Interesting circular architecture. Good for taking walks around during pomodoro breaks. Otherwise unremarkable. The antechamber might be the most impressive part. Has fucking _huge_ volumes if you want to take a funny picture for likes on social media.

## Taylor Bodleian Slavonic and Modern Greek Library

## Trinity College Library
## Tylor Library
Score not available.

I didn't know this existed until I saw it on the list. I suspect the only reason anyone would ever go there is if they mistook it for the Taylorian. (At 53 Banbury road, it lies further to the icy north than any student has ever dared to venture. It [looks](https://www.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/anthropology) small and shabby.)

## Vere Harmsworth Library at the Rothermere American Institute

7/10.

Underrated. Bright and airy, this hidden gem of a library is tucked behing Mansfield college. One side of the building is entirely transparent glass panels, looking onto the Mansfield lawn.

My favourite spot are the little nooks on the higher floors. You are sort of perched up there, facing the glass panels, with quite a lot of space below you. Each cubicle  is reserved, by name, for a graduate student at the American institute, but you can use them when the grad student is not there, which is most of the time. Once, I found a student's origami otter in her cubicle. In a speech bubble, it berated her: "you otter be working on your thesis!", but she was not there to heed its call, which I guess is a case or irony or something. 

The nooks are excellent: walled off to the sides, they function almost like a mini-office; the desks are ingeniously shaped at right-angles, to give you more usable space.

Location suboptimal.

## Weston Library
9/10
    
The library was established in 2015 (the year I arrived in Oxford) after extensive refurbishment of the New Bodleian Library building in which it is housed. The new facilities are incredibly luxurious, artfully combining old-style wood panels with pleasant, modern design. The specially designed chairs are amazing. I especially recommend the Charles Wendell David reading room on the top floor, which has light flooding in from all sides and offers an amazing view of the Old Bod and Rad Cam. There is only one donwside: since the Weston contains the Bodlein Libraries' special collections, no pens are allowed in the reading rooms. Pencils only, say signs everywhere.
