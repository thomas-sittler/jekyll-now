## Alexander Library of Ornithology
## All Souls College Library
7/10

The main feature of this library is the feeling of superiority & exclusivity that wafts over you when you enter the hallowed grounds of All Souls. You see, All Souls is a super-duper elite; it has no undergraduates, entry is by the so-called "[hardest exam in the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Souls_College,_Oxford)". You need to make a special application to be allowed to use the library (but it's actually very easy).

There are very few desks compared to the size of the library. The desks and seats are below average. Opening hours (Monday - Friday: 9:30am - 6:30pm) are the worst I've seen in Oxford.

9/10

A classic of the Oxford repertoire, the Old Bod needs no introduction and is located in one of the most magnificent buildings in the city. I prefer the upper reading room, which has better views and is sometimes less full. Special features: the divinity school, and Duke Humfrey's library, both of which were locations for the Harry Potter films. The Duke Humfrey is too dark, go there to enjoy the 17th-century vibe but not for extended periods of work.

5/10 

Interesting circular architecture. Good for taking walks around during pomodoro breaks. Otherwise unremarkable. The antechamber might be the most impressive part. Has fucking _huge_ volumes if you want to take a funny picture for likes on social media.

## Weston Library
9/10
    
The library was established in 2015 (the year I arrived in Oxford) after extensive refurbishment of the New Bodleian Library building in which it is housed. The new facilities are incredibly luxurious, artfully combining old-style wood panels with pleasant, modern design. The specially designed chairs are amazing. I especially recommend the Charles Wendell David reading room on the top floor, which has light flooding in from all sides and offers an amazing view of the Old Bod and Rad Cam. There is only one donwside: since the Weston contains the Bodlein Libraries' special collections, no pens are allowed in the reading rooms. Pencils only, say signs everywhere.
