I used the spaced repetition app [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net) to memorise material for PPE finals at Oxford. You can download them below. The quality varies a lot, and the formatting is inconsistent. Many of the cards are heavily customised for my use, and you may not find them helpful. Please also beware that these cards likely contain important errors. Some were reviewed only a few times so I wouldn't necessarily have caught all mistakes. My guess would be that on the order of 3% of cards contain a substantial error. If despite all this you still want to try them, here you go:

* [FHS102 Knowledge and Reality](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1084416481)
* [FHS103 Ethics](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/573874232)
* [FHS127 Philosophical Logic](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/898330155) and [Philosophical Logic proof toolkit](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1214939023)
* [FHS300 Quantitative economics](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/447476865)
* [FHS301 Macroeconomics](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/402595986)
* [FHS302 Microeconomics](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1250901560)
* [FHS314 Econometrics](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1128894400)
* [FHS319 Game theory](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1848073206)
