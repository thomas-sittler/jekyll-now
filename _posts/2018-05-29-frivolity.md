Oh love  
why are you  
so elusive?  
This morning  
you disappeared  
from my ontology.  
I too can be reduced  
to tears.

I met a dutch gambler in a dream,  
she had a mischievous, savage beauty.

We bet, and each wager did seem  
enticing, advantageous, truly.

But no matter the twists and turns of chance  
it was a sure loss, she had known in advance.

Oh I fell for her, but what I felt for her  
was only love.

For even the reasoner's art  
bends to the treasonous heart.
