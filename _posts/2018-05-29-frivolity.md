Oh love  
why are you  
so elusive?  
This morning  
you disappeared  
from my ontology.  
I too can be reduced  
to tears.

I met a Dutch gambler in a dream;  
she had a raw beauty, Savage and mischievous.

We bet and all her wagers did seem  
so full of promise, innocent and auspicious. 

But no matter the twists and turns of chance  
it was a sure loss, she had known in advance.

Oh I fell for her, but what I felt for her  
was only love.

For even the reasoner's art  
bends to the treasonous heart.
