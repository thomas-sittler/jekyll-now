i met a dutch gambler in a dream,
she had a mischievous, savage beauty.

we bet, and each wager did seem
enticing, advantageous, truly.

but no matter the twists and turns of chance
it was a sure loss, she had known in advance.

oh i fell for her, but what i felt for her
was only love.

for even the reasoner's art
bends to the treasonous heart.
